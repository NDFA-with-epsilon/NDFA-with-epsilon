### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I love to work with C, C++ and Rust, although Java is cool too.
I have worked on a few projects in these languages and I'm currently exploring Network Programming on Linux. <br>
Always open to exploring new technologies ! <br> <br>
I love to study about Operating System and Database engine internals and currently I am also working my way through [OS 161](http://www.os161.org/) in my free time, building the OS part by part and hopefully write it all in Rust!
